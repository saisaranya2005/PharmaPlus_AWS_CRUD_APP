# PharmaPlus Project

Welcome to the **PharmaPlus** project! üåøüíä This application is designed to efficiently manage medicine data, providing a user-friendly interface for adding, updating, and deleting medicine information. Below, you‚Äôll find an overview of the AWS services used to develop this full-stack application.

## ‚òÅÔ∏è AWS Services Utilized

1. **DynamoDB (Database)**:
   - **Purpose**: Stores medicine data such as Medicine ID, Name, use, expiry date etc.
   - **Functionality**: The Lambda function accesses this table to perform read (Scan) and write (PutItem) operations.

2. **Lambda (Serverless Backend)**:
   - **Purpose**: Contains the logic to interact with DynamoDB, allowing the addition and retrieval of medicine details.
   - **Functionality**: Lambda functions are invoked by API Gateway to perform these operations based on HTTP requests.

3. **API Gateway (REST API)**:
   - **Purpose**: Provides a REST API to access Lambda functions through various HTTP methods (POST, GET).
   - **Functionality**: Acts as an interface between the front-end (HTML/JavaScript) and the Lambda function, relaying user requests to Lambda.

4. **IAM (Access Control)**:
   - **Purpose**: Manages permissions and access control for AWS resources.
   - **Functionality**: IAM roles and policies grant the Lambda function the necessary permissions to read and write data in DynamoDB.

5. **AWS Amplify (Web Hosting)**:
   - **Purpose**: Hosts and deploys the front-end (HTML/JavaScript) of the PharmaPlus application.
   - **Functionality**: Amplify serves the front-end, which interacts with API Gateway to make requests that trigger Lambda functions.
